# Kits

Kits are also a big part of KnockBackFFA. They make it so players can have different items in their inventory when they join the game. In this guide, we will show you how to create and manage kits.

### item editor
Click on an item in the item editor to modify it. You can modify the display name and lore of the item and also the item itself. You can also toggle some things that the item can do like:
- Is it infinite?
- Is it a building block?
    - A building block name should always start with `minecraft:white_` because the system changes `white_` into `yellow_` than `orange_` and lastly `red_` before setting the block to air
- More are comming soon

## Selecting a kit
You can select a kit by using the command `/kit`.

## Deleting a kit
You can for now only delete a kit by going into the kits.yml file and deleting it yourself but this will soon be replaced by /kbffa kit delete
