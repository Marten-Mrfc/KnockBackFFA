# Kits

Kits are also a big part of KnockBackFFA. They make it so players can have different items in their inventory when they join the game. In this guide, we will show you how to create and manage kits.

Everything shown here can also be editted in the kits.yml file.

### item editor
Click on an item in the item editor to modify it. You can change the display name, lore, and the item itself. Additionally, there has been made an dynamic Modifier system. This system allows you to add custom modifiers to the item. The following modifiers are currently available:

- Delay Modifier: Adds a delay to an item (item must be a bow).
- BuildBlock Modifier: Makes the item buildblock.
  - A building block name should always start with `minecraft:white_` because the system changes `white_` to `yellow_`, then `orange_`, and finally `red_` before setting the block to air.
- On Kill Modifier: Restores item amount on kill.
- Execute Command Modifier: Executes a command on kill.
- Infinite Modifier: Makes the item infinite.
- JumpPad Modifier: A pressure plate that launches you upwards (item must be a pressure plate).
- More features are coming soon.
