# Arenas

Arenas are the dynamic battlegrounds where players engage in knockback combat. This guide covers everything you need to know about creating, managing, and optimizing arenas in KnockBackFFA.

## Arena System Overview

Arenas in KnockBackFFA rotate automatically based on your configuration settings. The plugin manages:
- Random arena selection at defined intervals
- Player teleportation between arenas
- Death detection via custom kill blocks
- Arena persistence between server restarts

## Creating Arenas

To create a new arena, use the command:

```
/kbffa arena create <name> <killblock>
```

Where:
- `<name>` is a unique identifier for your arena
- `<killblock>` is the material that will trigger player death (e.g., `WATER`, `LAVA`, `STRUCTURE_VOID`)

Example:
```
/kbffa arena create CoalMine COAL_BLOCK
```

This creates an arena named "CoalMine" at your current location, with `COAL_BLOCK` as the kill block.

## Managing Arenas

### Listing All Arenas

To see all available arenas:

```
/kbffa arena list
```

This displays all registered arenas with their locations and settings.

### Deleting Arenas

To remove an arena:

```
/kbffa arena delete <name>
```

Example:
```
/kbffa arena delete CoalMine
```

## Arena Configuration

Arenas are stored in `arena.yml` in your plugin directory. Each arena entry contains:

```yaml
arenas:
  CoalMine:
    location:
      world: world
      x: 100.5
      y: 64.0
      z: 200.5
      yaw: 90.0
      pitch: 0.0
    killBlock: COAL_BLOCK
```

## Arena Rotation Settings

The arena rotation interval is configured in `config.yml`:

```yaml
# Time in seconds before switching to another arena
mapDuration: 60
```

## Advanced Usage

### Kill Blocks

Kill blocks are special blocks that instantly kill players when they make contact.

### Best Practices

1. **Place spawn points strategically** - Ensure players spawn away from edges and kill blocks
2. **Design with knockback in mind** - Create platforms with adequate space for knockback mechanics
3. **Consider visibility** - Make kill zones clearly visible to prevent confusion
4. **Test thoroughly** - Check spawn points and kill block placement before going live

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing arenas**: Ensure `arena.yml` exists and contains valid arena data
- **Kill blocks not working**: Verify the block type exists in your Minecraft version
- **Players not teleporting**: Check world permissions and ensure PvP is enabled
