# Arenas

Arenas are a big part of KnockBackFFA. They are the places where players will fight each other. In this guide, we will show you how to create and manage arenas.

## Creating an arena
To create an arena, use the command:
`/kbffa arena create (name) (killblock)`

Replace `(name)` with the name you want for the arena and `(killblock)` with the block that will kill players upon contact. For example, if you want the void to be the killblock, use minecraft:structure_void and place these blocks at the bottom of your map.

## Deleting arenas
To delete an arena, use the command:
`/kbffa arena delete (name)`
