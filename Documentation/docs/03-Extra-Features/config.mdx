# Config settings
The config also contains some configurations you can change.

## Settings
- `mapDuration: 600` - The duration between map switches.
- `allowDropping: false` - If players can drop items.
- `allowPickUp: false` - If players can pick up items.
- `allowBlockBreaking: false` - If players can break blocks.
- `allowDamage: false` - If players can damage each other.

## Scoreboard
You can also fully customize the scoreboard to your likings.

## currentArena & currentLocation
These 2 are useless if you change them because these are changing each map switch this is just an easy way for me to save and pull what map currently is playing.
