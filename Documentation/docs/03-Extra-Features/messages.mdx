# MultiLanguage

This guide will walk you through how the translation system works in KnockbackFFA, showing you how to add new languages or customize existing translations.

## How Translations Work

KnockbackFFA uses YAML files to store translations organized by language. The system loads these files at startup and manages language selection based on your server configuration.

### Translation File Structure

Translation files are stored in the `lang` folder within the plugin's data directory:

```
plugins/KnockbackFFA/lang/
├── en.yml    # English (default)
├── nl.yml    # Dutch
└── ...       # Other languages
```

Each language file follows the same structure with nested keys organizing different categories of messages:

- Player messages
- Scoreboard text
- Arena-related messages
- Kit messages
- Shop text
- Boost messages
- Error messages
- Command responses

## Setting the Language

To change the language used by the plugin:

1. Open the main `config.yml` file
2. Find the `language` setting
3. Set it to your preferred language code (e.g., `en` for English, `nl` for Dutch)
4. Reload the plugin using `/kbffa reload`

```yaml
# Example config.yml
language: en  # Change to your preferred language code
```

## Adding a New Language

To create a new language file:

1. Copy the `en.yml` file as a template
2. Rename it to your language code (e.g., `fr.yml` for French)
3. Translate all messages in the file
4. Reload the plugin with `/kbffa reload`

The plugin will automatically detect your new language file on reload.

## Understanding Placeholders

Translations use placeholders that get replaced with dynamic content. Placeholders are surrounded by angle brackets, like `<player_name>` or `<arena_name>`.

Example:
```yaml
arena:
  switch:
    success: "<green>Teleported to arena <white><arena_name><green>!"
```

In this example, `<arena_name>` will be replaced with the actual arena name when the message is displayed.

## Color and Formatting

Messages support [MiniMessage](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html) format for colors and styling:

- `<color>text</color>` - Apply colors like `<green>`, `<red>`, `<white>`
- `<b>text</b>` - Bold text
- `<i>text</i>` - Italic text

Example:
```yaml
player:
  kit_applied: "<green>Selected kit <white><kit_name>"
```

## Translation Fallbacks

If a translation is missing in the selected language, the system will automatically fall back to English. This ensures players always see messages even if some translations are incomplete.

## Reloading Translations

After making changes to any language file, use the command:

```
/kbffa reload
```

This will refresh all translations without requiring a server restart.

## Tips for Translators

1. Maintain all placeholders when translating
2. Keep formatting tags like colors and styling
3. Test your translations in-game after reloading
4. Consider the context of each message for accurate translation
